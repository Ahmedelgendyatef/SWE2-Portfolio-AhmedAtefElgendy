Reflection
What I learned:
Through this task, I learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming using C++.
I understood how to design a base class and derive multiple subclasses from it.
I learned how encapsulation works by using private data members with public getters and setters.
I also learned how polymorphism allows different classes to provide their own implementation
of the same function using virtual and overridden methods.
This task helped me better understand abstraction by using an abstract base class
to define a common interface for different types of cars.
