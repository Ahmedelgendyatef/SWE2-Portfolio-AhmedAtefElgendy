Reflection

 What I learned:
I learned how to apply SOLID principles in C++ using a practical example.
I understood how separating responsibilities improves code readability
and maintainability.
I also learned how interfaces can be used to avoid forcing classes
to implement unnecessary methods.
This task helped me see how abstraction and polymorphism make the system
easy to extend without modifying existing code.
