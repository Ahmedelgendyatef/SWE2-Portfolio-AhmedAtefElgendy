Reflection
What I learned:
I learned how to apply multiple design patterns in a single C++ application.
I understood how each design pattern solves a specific problem and how
they work together to build a clean and flexible system.
This task helped me understand the importance of separating responsibilities
and reducing coupling between different components.
I also improved my ability to design scalable and reusable code
using design patterns in real scenarios.
